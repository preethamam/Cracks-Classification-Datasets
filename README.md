# Cracks classification datasets
Cracks are the defects formed by cyclic loading, fatigue, shrinkage, creep, and so on. In addition, they represent the deterioration of the structures over some time. Therefore, it is essential to detect and classify them according to the condition grade at the early stages to prevent the collapse of structures. Deep learning and machine learning-based supervised classification methods requires carefully annotated images of cracks. This is a repository of human annotated classification datasets of concrete, pavement, walls/mixed and masonry/bricks cracks surface. I collected these datasets during my Ph.D. days and used many for my dissertation.

## Datasets examples
| No. | Dataset name | Cracks images | Non-cracks images | Remarks |
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- |  ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | [Cracks-5.7K (227x227)](https://1drv.ms/f/c/49b23bc11eecd6a8/EtBNtnET4YtFmuJCKQXWLRcBywLJiQy6tVR8nIw-a2hkZQ?e=f49fEx) | ![](assets/Dataset_1_Cracks-5.7K_(227x227)_crack.png) | ![](assets/Dataset_1_Cracks-5.7K_(227x227)_noncrack.png) | Concrete and pavement surface images. This dataset has a great variety with types of cracks and texture. Highly textureous and cracks width varies largely. Types of cracks include a few strands, branched and surface.| 
| 2 | [Cracks-3.7K (644x483)](https://1drv.ms/f/c/49b23bc11eecd6a8/ErWfsmYD6FdKof52qUiJ7hUBAVS50eAoo32WQJBDNPVzFw?e=IfcLua) | ![](assets/Dataset_2_Cracks-3.7K_(644x483)_crack.png) | ![](assets/Dataset_2_Cracks-3.7K_(644x483)_noncrack.png) | Purely a concrete surface images. This dataset has a cracks with a few strands and some branches. Highly textureous and cracks width varies largely. |
| 3 | [Cracks-26.7K (644x483)](https://1drv.ms/f/c/49b23bc11eecd6a8/ErI4bqgf_ClPujbQGGkq9RABmMnL0kt-0yuvPFMMqPBnUw?e=TyzvCw) | ![](assets/Dataset_3_Cracks-26.7K_(644x483)_crack.png) | ![](assets/Dataset_3_Cracks-26.7K_(644x483)_noncrack.png) | This is a mixture of concrete and pavement surface images. This dataset has a cracks with a few strands, some branches and surface types. Highly textureous and cracks width varies largely. |
| 4 | [Cracks-1.3K](https://1drv.ms/f/c/49b23bc11eecd6a8/Egqz7v0s5glAn8InjAHBfWIBK6Gwq-c5_afnr8C74RztMA?e=qpojee) | ![](assets/Dataset_4_Cracks-1.3K_crack.png) | ![](assets/Dataset_4_Cracks-1.3K_noncrack.png) | This dataset is the most diverse and consists of concrete, pavement, walls and glass surface images. This dataset has a cracks with a few strands, thin, thick, branched and surface. Highly textureous and cracks width varies largely. I call this dataset as ***The Wild Wild West*** because of its diversity and different images size. |
